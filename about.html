                <h2>About Me & This Website</h2>
                <p>Hi there! My name is Shifat, and welcome to my pet project, Probashi-Footballers.com</p>
                <p>A quick “about me”: I’m a lifelong football (soccer) fanatic in the US/Canada. My love for the game has taken me on a wild journey, especially after moving to Canada in high school and following the men’s national team- from losing 8-1 to Honduras, to the miracle run to qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar (which I was there for!).</p>
                <p>From that journey, I realised that a key part of Canada’s success was its recruitment of dual-national players. A fan-run website called ‘Canucks Abroad’ tracked this recruitment effort. Taking inspiration from it, I realized that Bangladesh, too, needs its own centralized database, especially after seeing Bangladesh start its own transition by convincing stars like Hamza Choudhury and Shamit Shome to represent the green and red. Because let's face it- it’s hard to believe we have this many Bangladeshi immigrants all over the world, and we can’t find 11 good players to represent the national team.</p>
                <p>I first started this website in August 2025, with just a handful of players listed. Thanks to an incredible response from the community on social media, it has now grown to over hundreds, with more to be discovered. </p>
                <p>This site is my contribution to the future of Bangladeshi football—a comprehensive, fan-driven database of the diaspora players who could help elevate our national team to new heights.</p>
