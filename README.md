# Probashi-Footballers.com
Probashi Footballers is a website intended to track players with Bangladeshi heritage based outside of Bangladesh, who could become the next Men's or Women's National Team stars. 
Inspired by '[Canucks Abroad](https://www.canucks-abroad.ca/)', which is a website that tracks the roster of dual national Canadian players, I realized that Bangladesh, too, needs a similar database of dual-national players. 

This Github repository is used for version control of the database- which are simply stored as .csv files; and to deploy the website over Github Pages for presentation. 

I first started this website project in August 2025, with just a handful of players listed.
Thanks to an incredible response from the community on social media, it has now grown to over hundreds, with more to be discovered.
This site is my contribution to the future of Bangladeshi football—a comprehensive, fan-driven database of the diaspora players who could help elevate our national team to new heights.

# Data Sources & Methodology
The database is compiled from following sources:
1. Official club websites and rosters
2. Football federation registrations
3. Scouting reports and agent information
4. Social media posts and accounts
5. Community submissions from supporters

# Want to Contribute?
If you want to help contribute to the database by providing new player information, existing player updates, etc; please feel free to send me a DM on [Twitter/X (@dr_shiffles)](https://x.com/dr_shiffles) or send me a message on Transfermarkt (drshiffles).
~~Or, since we're on GitHub, I guess you can do a pull request? Idk, I'm not sure GitHub was originally intended as a way to do version control on a bunch of .csv files, but it's working for me, so I think you could do a pull-request.~~
I plan on setting up a template so player submissions can be made from GitHub through the "Issues" menu, or another method on GitHub that may be more suitable. 

In the original version of the website made with Google Sites and Google Sheets (very similar to what [Canucks Abroad](https://www.canucks-abroad.ca/) has set up, minus the submission form), I offered the option of providing submissions via a Google Form. Unfortunately, some Internet Trolls got the wind of it right after the AFC Asian Cup Qualification game back in November 2025, and decided to spam the form with some choice words about me, Forge FC, and Bangladesh. As such, I had to take it down, and I have no plans of resuming the Google Form method, as I am trying to reduce this website's dependency on Google Services. (Not that I have a personal problem with them, I just want to make it easier to contribute without relying on Google)

# Want to fork this website for other countries?
Sure! Generally everything should work, as long as your database follows the same formatting. 

# AI Usage Disclaimer
This website was created in part with AI/LLM tools such as DeepSeek and ChatGPT, to aid with the presentation of the data on the web. The player database and its contents are manually collected and organized by community volunteers through the sources mentioned in the Methodology section above.
