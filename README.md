Probashi-Footballers.com is a website intended to track players with Bangladeshi heritage based outside of Bangladesh, who could become the next Men's or Women's National Team stars. 

Inspired by 'Canucks Abroad', which is a website that tracks the roster of dual national Canadian players, I realized that Bangladesh, too, needs a similar database of dual-national players.
