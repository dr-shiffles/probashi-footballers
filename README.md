# Probashi-Footballers.com
Probashi-Footballers.com is a website intended to track players with Bangladeshi heritage based outside of Bangladesh, who could become the next Men's or Women's National Team stars. 

Inspired by 'Canucks Abroad', which is a website that tracks the roster of dual national Canadian players, I realized that Bangladesh, too, needs a similar database of dual-national players. 

This Github repository is used for version control of the database- which are simply stored as .csv files; and to deploy the website over Github Pages for presentation.
